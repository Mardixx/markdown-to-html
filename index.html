    <h2>"<em>Funny</em>" Story</h2>

    <p>One day I went on a camping trip in highschool, I was really excited because I had never done anything even remotly close to camping. We went for a week in a camping resort and one of the activities there was rock climbing.  <br>
    
    I was <b>super</b> excited because I wanted to try it for <b>so</b> long and I could finally <b>do it</b>, about half way through the <em>trip</em> we had to take a zipline as an activity. We weren't <b>forced</b> to, but, even though I was scared I decided to take a <em>leap of faith</em> and went for it.<br> Upon landing I sprained my foot. At first, I thought it was just a bad landing and pushed through the <b>pain</b>. It wasn't. Upon arriving to the next activity, the pain was so bad that I couldn't <em>walk</em> anymore and had to go back to the camping site and wait for the trip to end. <br>When I got back home, the pain was still there but not as bad as before, so, I didn't go to the hospital (<em>dumb idea</em>). It still hurts to this day. &#128514 </p>

    <h3>Recap</h3>

    <p>I went on a camping trip, had a bad landing on a zipline, didn't go to the hospital. It still hurts sometimes.</p>

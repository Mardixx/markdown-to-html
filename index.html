## "*Funny*" Story

One day I went on a camping trip in highschool, I was really excited because I had never done anything even remotly close to camping. We went for a week in a camping resort and one of the activities there was rock climbing.  
  
I was **super** excited because I wanted to try it for **so** long and I could finally **do it**, about half way through the *trip* we had to take a zipline as an activity. We weren't **forced** to, but, even though I was scared I decided to take a *leap of faith* and went for it. Upon landing I sprained my foot. At first, I thought it was just a bad landing and pushed through the **pain**. It wasn't. Upon arriving to the next activity, the pain was so bad that I couldn't *walk* anymore and had to go back to the camping site and wait for the trip to end. When I got back home, the pain was still there but not as bad as before, so, I didn't go to the hospital (*dumb idea*). It still hurts to this day. :joy:

### Recap 

I went on a camping trip, had a bad landing on a zipline, didn't go to the hospital. It still hurts sometimes.
